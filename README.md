Welcome to Foodly!

## Intro
Can't decide where to eat? Too many suggestions and not enough time?
Well, don't let that stop you! Foodly can help you and your friends to vote on where to eat lunch.
That's right, we're democratising lunch!
But don't forget, whoever has their suggestions win the most votes will get to be on the podium. Let the eating begin....

## Features
* Send out a survey each day asking people to submit suggestions for where to eat. You can also cast your vote on where you want to eat.
* Receive a message before lunch telling you which place received the most votes
* Launch a channel for everyone who voted, so you can discuss your lunch plans!
* See a breakdown of the number of votes that each suggestion received

## Upcoming Features
* Google Calendar integration, add your lunch destination to your calendar
* See data on what the most popular places, cuisines and locations are
